This project introduces an interactive real estate profitability tool, designed to help both novice and expert real estate investors make informed decisions in the competitive U.S. housing market. The tool integrates key financial metrics such as Cash Flow, Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM), Capitalization Rate (Cap rate), and Cash-on-Cash Return with demographic and socioeconomic data to provide a comprehensive analysis of property profitability. Our tool also contains dynamic visualizations with ARIMA-based forecasting models, offering users both immediate insights and future market trends.  

    To create the interactive visuals, we used Tableau as our platform of choice. Hence, our installation and demo package contains a Tableau file that is loaded with the necessary data to run. The file consists of two dashboards: 

1. Opportunity Scorecard: A city/state level map color-coded by investment metrics, including Cash Flow, GRM, Cap Rate, and Cash-on-Cash Return.
2. Opportunity Explorer: A zip-code/MSA-level map and calculator that lets users input property details to generate key investment metrics, benchmarking results against industry standards to help evaluate potential opportunities.


    To install and run this tool, please ensure you have the Tableau desktop application installed. Then, download the Tableau file. Open the file in the Tableau app and you are free to explore its contents thereafter!
